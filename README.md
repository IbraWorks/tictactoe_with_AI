This game uses the gem 'colorize'. In order to play the game, you will need to have
[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) as well as [Bundler](https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001070131-Using-Bundler-to-install-Ruby-gems) installed on your machine.

Go into your terminal, locate where you would like to install the game and run the
following commands to play.

```

Note: one of the tests is an ai vs ai end to end integration test, and therefore
may take a little while to complete. Be patient :)
